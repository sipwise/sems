  Additionally to normal timer operation (setting and removing timer,
  fire the timer when it is expired), this RegistrationTimer timers 
  class needs to support insert_timer_leastloaded() which should insert 
  the timer in some least loaded interval between from_time and to_time
  in order to flatten out re-register spikes (due to restart etc).

  Timer granularity is seconds.

  Timers are saved in buckets of TIMER_BUCKET_LENGTH seconds. the buckets
  array is a circular one, the current bucket starts from the time 
  current_bucket_start (in seconds as in time(2)).

  The timer object is owned by the caller, and MUST be valid until it is
  fired or removed.
