      "message": "I guess that depends on how the service reacts to a forced SIGKILL, and whether there\u0027s a chance for it to damage databases or on-disk data, etc. OTOH I assume the sysvinit script was using --retry on the s-s-d call which would have forced a SIGKILL too at some point?\n\nHah, checking now it seems it was just using --signal 9, which means it was not even sending a SIGTERM first, but a SIGKILL straight away! So it seems rather safe to lower the timeout, probably even further down. :)",
