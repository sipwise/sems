      "message": "I guess that depends on how the service reacts to a forced SIGKILL, and whether there\u0027s a chance for it to damage databases or on-disk data, etc. OTOH I assume the sysvinit script was using --retry on the s-s-d call which would have forced a SIGKILL too at some point?\n\nHah, checking now it seems it was just using --signal 9, which means it was not even sending a SIGTERM first, but a SIGKILL straight away! So it seems rather safe to lower the timeout, probably even further down. :)",

      "message": "What it was doing in the case of the bug report was to KILL later, but to KILL anyway.  The only way in which this would make it worse would be to maybe kill the process in cases where it\u0027s slower to shut down than 10s but faster than 90s, if this ever happens.\n\nBut yeah, as you say, with sysvinit (thanks for the research!) was even worse, so this point is moot now.\n\nI added the maintainers to the review so they can comment in the case that they think that it\u0027s unsafe, to have a chance to fix it now :)",
